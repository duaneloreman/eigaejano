Before you ask, yes, I have way too much time on my hands. I work at a help desk and there was a fire in the server room, so guess who's currently getting paid to do nothing? Welcome to Role Call, where I compare that 5‚òÖ you chased but didn't get, to the 4‚òÖ, 3‚òÖ, or free unit that you DID get! I try to be subjective but hey shit happens. And in being too nervous to use any of my UoC, I figure now is as good a time as any to elaborate on Magic Tanks since FFBE gave us a chance at a free, highly. Finn Balor says that he has dealt with his fears and used that to empower his demon and lets it take over. Brock Lesnar does the same with the Beast inside him. Hulk Hogan has Mr. America, and the list goes on. Let's not forget about Mick Foley and his alters; and Bray Wyatt and Sister Abigail. If you have seen the movie "Split", you would understand. Rewind back to the last episode of Raw, you could see that Mojo Rawley was talking to his alter-ego. ‚ÄúI do it so infrequently now that I forget. I need to tell you about some things that have been weighing me down for awhile now. I never asked for this diagnosis, and I never felt that I was disorderly. Okay fine , maybe a little bit. but I just have a thing against labels. amp#x200B; I had periods of denial in which I would discover very strange connections to this condition. amp#x200B; I'm really curious to see your thoughts on all of this, and I hope you'll find it interesting. amp#x200B; https://catholicexchange.com/did. ### 2019 Releases (https://www.psybient.org/love/2019-releases-psychill-ambient-downtempo/) üîπüî∂üîπ Upcoming Releases (https://www.psybient.org/love/upcoming-releases-psychill-ambient-downtempo/) üîπüî∂üîπ Best of 2018 Spotify Playlist (https://open.spotify.com/user/timeisart/playlist/38SNqqijHNAu6z5jVKajiL) --- ### Previous Week's Releases (January 21-27) (https://www.reddit.com/r/Psybient/comments/akupct/weekly_psybient_releases_update_poll_january_2127/) --- #Latest Releases (January 28 - Februar. ### 2019 Releases (https://www.psybient.org/love/2019-releases-psychill-ambient-downtempo/) üîπüî∂üîπ Upcoming Releases (https://www.psybient.org/love/upcoming-releases-psychill-ambient-downtempo/) üîπüî∂üîπ Best of 2018 Spotify Playlist (https://open.spotify.com/user/timeisart/playlist/38SNqqijHNAu6z5jVKajiL) --- ### Previous Week's Releases (February 11-17) (https://www.reddit.com/r/Psybient/comments/as1ob5/weekly_psybient_releases_update_poll_february/) --- #Latest Releases (February 18-24): ### 2019 Releases (https://www.psybient.org/love/2019-releases-psychill-ambient-downtempo/) üîπüî∂üîπ Upcoming Releases (https://www.psybient.org/love/upcoming-releases-psychill-ambient-downtempo/) üîπüî∂üîπ Best of 2018 Spotify Playlist (https://open.spotify.com/user/timeisart/playlist/38SNqqijHNAu6z5jVKajiL) --- ### Previous Week's Releases (February 4-10) (https://www.reddit.com/r/Psybient/comments/apl4iv/weekly_psybient_releases_update_poll_february_410/) --- #Latest Releases (February 11-17): Sooo, I eventually decided to do the AA SBs challenges on all the released neo torments. Rather than creating a thread for every clear, I decided to put them all here. Common rules: Only SBs obtainable from the Acolyte Archive selection (https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/wiki/acolyte_archives) are used. No LMRs No 5 magicites No synergy equip outside from that picked in the AA selection. I still use LDed characters (though most of the ones I use are popular ones) 
I strongly believe that to understand how each type views the world, you look at the art they make and swear by. For this purpose I started r/MBTIRadioStation so that there's a place to discuss Music + Psychology + MBTI. I think musicians and artists explore a lot of their psyche and shadow through their art. Art is the greatest healer ! To understand the music r/INFJ likes and loves, I searched for "music" on the searchbar and pulled out some of the songs you peeps have posted here. ### 2019 Releases (https://www.psybient.org/love/2019-releases-psychill-ambient-downtempo/) üîπüî∂üîπ Upcoming Releases (https://www.psybient.org/love/upcoming-releases-psychill-ambient-downtempo/) üîπüî∂üîπ Best of 2018 Spotify Playlist (https://open.spotify.com/user/timeisart/playlist/38SNqqijHNAu6z5jVKajiL) --- ### Previous Week's Releases (January 14-20) (https://www.reddit.com/r/Psybient/comments/aifuvu/weekly_psybient_releases_update_poll_january_1420/) --- #Latest Releases (January 21-27): \ \ \ I made numerous edits based on user suggestions.

So, I did some personal resear. Greetings intrepid reader and comrade of Gungir emporium! This here, if you're new or otherwise so bored you actually decided to give this a click, is role call, where we go over the 5‚òÖ Base you wanted, but instead got a 3‚òÖ or 4‚òÖ that fulfills a similar role instead. My previous two forays into r/FFBE walls of texts were on Provoke tanks, and although I'm likely doing Cover tanks next, this here edition is special because my second favorite Black Mage nudist in the game got her enhancements. ### 2018 Releases (https://www.psybient.org/love/2018-releases-psychill-ambient-downtempo/) üîπüî∂üîπ Upcoming Releases (https://www.psybient.org/love/upcoming-releases-psychill-ambient-downtempo/) üîπüî∂üîπ Best of 2018 Spotify Playlist (https://open.spotify.com/user/timeisart/playlist/38SNqqijHNAu6z5jVKajiL) --- ### Previous Week's Releases (December 26-31) (https://www.reddit.com/r/Psybient/comments/abvwen/weekly_psybient_releases_update_poll_december/) --- #Latest Releases (January 1-6): üåé Artist. Hello, FFBE reddit users! I thought I would try to do my part in contributing some worthwhile analysis to this subreddit in the form of taking a deeper look into the LB mechanics of some of our future 7\ candidates here. Please keep in mind that this is focusing on units that are either acquirable currently or in the near future, and their proposed LB mechanics based on the info pulled from https://exviusdb.com (https://exviusdb.com). Apologies if my formatting is bad. The following. Mostly jazz here, but other genre's too.  minimum order,  shipping for any amount sent Media Mail, tracked in the US. Shipping from Illinois. Please inquire for international. Links below lead to my Discogs site that contain additional detail about the LPs condition. I crammed as many in this post as possible, but feel free to pick from MY Discogs (https://www.discogs.com/seller/Doctor_of_Jazz/profile?sort=artist%2Casc) as well to bundle. Grades are VINYL / JACKET. Thanks!.
